Subject- Creating a device that would help us detect living beings from above during a natural disaster.

Idea- The idea is to create an IOT device that would automatically detect the heat signatures of the living beings trapped inside the zome of damage/disaster from above i.e. helicopter etc. and an immediate help could provided without any loss of time. This would decrease the time for searching and increase the efficiency for the help providing teams.

Materials Required- Raspberry Pi, Thermal Sensor (Atleast for small distances for now)

Purpose- Segregating the actual heat signatures of beings and burned/burning non living parts, also differentiating among who is alive and who is not (Heat signatures are different for both of them).
